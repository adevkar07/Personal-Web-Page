          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
             Hello!! 
          </p>
          <p>            
             I am an avid reader, coder, traveler, hiker and a chef sometimes! 
             I am also a graduate student pursuing masters in Computer Science at UTD. I did my bachelors in India and worked for about a year at Netcracker Technologies Pvt. Ltd. This summer I interned as a Full Stack Software Engineer with Ellie Mae at their El Segundo, CA location. I have expertise in JAVA and would love to work in JAVA! Apart from Software Engineering projects I also like to work on projects which deal with machine learning and cyber security.

          <h5>
              Credit Card Fault Detection
          </h5>
          <p>
            I worked on this problem statement so as to be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions from overall transactions. The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions which was one of the challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used 2 techniques for this, one was by Anomaly Detection using two machine Learning Algorithms: 
            Local Outlier Factor  and Isolation Forest Algorithm. I found that even though I could achieve accuracy of 99.75% for Isolation forest, it is misleading as it falls for False Negatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, as a solution to this, I worked with Logistic Regression. To achieve stability in dataset, I under-sampled it. I used cross-validation for calculating accuracy obtained was about 92.5% and I calculated it using cross-validation technique such as K-fold.
          </p>

          <h5>
             Enron Email Analysis
          </h5>
          <p>
              The Enron email dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of Enron's collapse.
          </p>
          <p>
              I performed Sentiment Analysis over these emails for understanding the effective features and correlation between them. On this basis, I performed feature engineering to create some new features and checked their influence over the output parameter which is Identifying the person of interest.
          </p>

          <h5>
              Data Safeguarding against Internal and External Threats
          </h5>
          <p>
              This was the final year project sponsored by Biz Secure Pvt. Ltd, one of pioneering firm in the field of Cyber Security in India.          
              The project provided solution against Internal and External Threats to crucial corporate as well as personal data systems. 
              Internal threats comprised of stealing of data through the use of portable USB in corporates as they have confidential and critical data within their various departments. Device identification , authentication of the device, policy creation and encryption were among the modules. We developed a new encryption algorithm for the same which also comprised of the signature within the file.
              External Threat was mainly concerned with Ransomware. We built a system which would detect the presence of Ransomware in the system and killing it causing prevention from further damage to the system. 
          </p>
          <p>        
              A research paper is also published based on the same.
